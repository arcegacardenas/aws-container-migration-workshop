=== Introduction
This section walks you through the creating a Kubernetes development
environment using https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/[AWS Cloud9].  This will provide
you with a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that will let
you write, run, and debug containerized workloads using just a web browser.
We will also deploy an RDS instance, ECR repository and a Jenkins instance for
the CI/CD portion of the workshop.

=== Create AWS Cloud9 Environment

==== AWS Cloud9 Console

We can create the Cloud9 development environment via CloudFormation.
This CloudFormation template will spin up the Cloud9 IDE, as well as configure the IDE environment for the rest of the workshop.

Click on the *Deploy to AWS* button and follow the CloudFormation prompts to begin.

// [NOTE]
// Please choose the region closest to you.

|===

|Region | Launch template in a new VPC
| *Oregon* (us-west-2)

|===

To open the Cloud9 IDE environment, click on the *Outputs* tab in CloudFormation Console and click on the *Cloud9Endpoint* URL.

You should see an environment similar to this:

=== Build Script

Once your Cloud9 environment is ready, download the build script and install in your IDE. This will prepare your IDE for running tutorials in this workshop. The build script installs the following:

- `jq`
- `kubectl`
- `kops`
- `aws`
- creates an SSH key
- clone the workshop repository into Cloud9

To install the script, run this command in the *bash* terminal tab of the Cloud9 IDE:

[source,shell]
----
aws s3 cp s3://aws-container-migration-workshop/lab-ide-build.sh . && \
chmod +x lab-ide-build.sh && \
. ./lab-ide-build.sh
----

At this point you can restart the Cloud9 IDE terminal session to ensure that the `kubectl` completion is enabled. Once a new terminal window is opened, type `kubectl get nodes`. *You do not have to run the command.* It is normal for this command to fail with an error message if you run it. You have not yet created the Kubernetes cluster. We are merely testing to make sure the `kubectl` tool is installed on the command line correctly and can autocomplete.

[IMPORTANT]
One last step is required so that the Cloud9 IDE uses the assigned IAM Instance profile. Open the *AWS Cloud9* menu, go to *Preferences*, go to *AWS Settings*, and disable *AWS managed temporary credentials* as depicted in the diagram here:

==== Create kops cluster

[source,shell]
----
kops create cluster \
  --name example.cluster.k8s.local \
  --zones $AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONES \
  --yes
----

=== Validation

We deployed a good amount of AWS resources and infrastructure, before moving on lets perform a few validation tests to assure everything is working as intended.

==== Validate Postgres Connection
Check the Outputs from the main CloudFormation stack and look for the *RDSEndpoint*.

Connect to your postgresql instance:

[source,shell]
----
psql -h <RDSEndpoint> -U petstore -d postgres
----

This should prompt you for a password with is `petstore`.

Next we can create the `petstore` database once we have authenticated.

[source,shell]
----
CREATE DATABASE petstore;
----

Show all databases:

[source,shell]
----
\l
----

Exit database:

[source,shell]
----
\q
----

==== Validate Jenkins Connection

From the cloudformation output retrieve the *JenkinsIP* and open in a browser. The credentials are as follows:

[source,shell]
----
u: jenkins
p: jenkins101
----

==== Validate Kubernetes Cluster

After the `kops create cluster` command has finished it will talk a couple minutes before the cluster is accessible. To test this run:

[source,shell]
----
kops validate cluster
----
