== Hybrid Environment Considerations and Architectures

=== Expected Outcome:
- Understand general architectural considerations for Hybrid Deployments.

=== Lab Requirements:
None

=== Average Lab Time:
10 Minutes.

=== Introduction
Deploying applications into a Hybrid environment requires many considerations. These include primarily latency, connection stability and connection throughput between each environment. Depending on these factors, a decision can be made regarding the specific deployment strategy for each application. We have identified
